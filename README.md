 # Korben, Mr. Vitali

I build things. I won't be using AI to write this out.

I specialize in AI in pythong with libraries like pytorch, transformers and selenium.

I believe that in the next 5 years the workforce will be dominated by autonomous agents that can be customized to serve any business or individual, and fine-tuned for any task involving a computer.

Here's some of my past projects:

## PC organization assistant:

A buddy of mine isn't computer savvy, so we made his computer talk. He could open up a conversational model that could scan and remember every file in his computer, so he could ask questions like 'Where is my resume?' or 'How many productive apps do I have and which are the best?'.

AI like chatGPT and Grok are great, but useless when it comes to being personalized without selling your data to their 1000 page privacy policies. This model ran locally, with no internet. How it should.

## AI-run CRM

Another friend of mine runs a small handyman company, that takes tons of invoices and requests via E-mail. They'd manually sort through and enter the data into their CRM, until we introduced a fully custom, private 'concierge' that could read all incoming emails and sort them into the database automatically.

Currently, I'm working on growing and training the model so eventually they can have it understand and predict their business decisions, and take actions like SENDING emails, invoicing or even writing code to improve its own CRM.

# My own personal project

As we speak I'm writing this, but the moment I'm done its back to studying python and other AI modules. My personal bucket-list projects are as follows:

## My own hyper-personal assistant

Assistants as they stand today are boring. I'm working on one that not only knows me on a deep, personal level; but is locally-run, encrypted, and most importantly can DO things while I sleep. Scrape websites for data like good facebook marketplace listings, buy and sell my crypto for short-term profits, even shoot this portfolio to anybody on twitter posting about needing an AI developer.

The biggest hurdle I'm working on is self-replication, where my model will have access to my computers terminal to code and replicate itself into duplicates and eventually create a swarm that all communicate with eachother and take actions, logging thier activity and ultimately freeing up my time so I can study more while the cash rolls in.

Hope you like what you read, the future is bright.
